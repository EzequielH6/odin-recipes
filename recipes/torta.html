    <h4> Finally, here are some key steps to creating the most <em> delicious</em> Mexican Torta:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large skillet or a pan over medium heat and add the olive oil or any oil you prefer. Add the chorizo sausages and crumble the meat into the pan with the back of a wooden spoon.</li>
        <li>Cook stirring constantly until the flavorful pork chorizo is lightly crispy and cooked through (about 8 minutes).</li>
        <li>While the chorizo is cooking, slice the telera or bolillos rolls in half and lightly butter the crumb.</li>
        <li>Heat a griddle or a comal and toast the bread on all sides until slightly golden and crisp.</li>
        <li>Spread mayonnaise and mustard on the crumb of each top piece of the rolls. Add a layer of refried beans on the crumb or each bottom piece.</li>
        <li> Once the chorizo is cooked, spoon it on top of the refried beans, then arrange a few slices of cheese if you want.</li>
        <li>Follow with lettuce, tomato slices, onions, avocado, and then jalapeño peppers. Season lightly with a sprinkle of salt.</li>
        <li>Close the sandwich and repeat the steps to assemble 3 more tortas and serve immediately or pack them for later.</li>
